            My name is Tatiana Millsap and I am a recent graduate with a Bachelors in Web Development. I have a long term love of technology and art and when I discovered web development I knew it was a match made in heaven. Feel free to browse my projects and see what I have created thus far. I love minimal yet colorful designs that provide a delicately curated web experience from start to finish. I hope you enjoy and decide to add me to your award winning team!
